We, the Biodiversity Genomics Group at the University of Oulu, focus on applied research in the field of conservation and environmental genomics, 
biodiversity monitoring, and wildlife forensics since 2023. Our research comprises a variety of study species, such as Siberian flying squirrels, 
cheetahs, bay mussels and insects. We cover a range of habitats, from local river systems to the Atlantic, Arctic and Southern Ocean, from the 
rainforests of South America to the tundra and taiga environments of Finland. We are applying state-of-the-art genomic methods such as on-site 
whole-genome sequencing and targeted genome capture, ancient DNA analysis, and epigenomics as well as inexpensive, non-invasive monitoring 
techniques such as SNP-genotyping, metabarcoding and methylation profiling to address conservation questions. A central part of our work is local 
capacity building, engagement of the public, close collaboration with national and international stakeholders, and the development of applied 
genetic tools that aid in nature conservation.
